# FedBlockParadox

This repository contains a custom-built simulator for decentralized federated learning systems. The simulator is implemented in Python and is designed to replicate the behavior of a blockchain-assisted federated learning system in a fully decentralized environment. It supports the simulation of various configurations, allowing experimentation with different consensus mechanisms, validation techniques, and aggregation methods.

The simulator aims to facilitate research and analysis in decentralized federated learning, providing a powerful tool to study vulnerabilities, test defensive mechanisms, and evaluate system performance under diverse configurations.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Flexible Configuration**: Use a JSON configuration file to customize datasets, node behaviors, consensus algorithms (e.g., PoW, PoS, committee-based), and validation mechanisms.
- **Malicious Node Behavior**: Simulate common malicious trainer behaviors such as label flipping, additive noise, and targeted data poisoning.
- **Dataset Management**: Partition datasets into IID or N-IID subsets, allowing diverse training scenarios.
- **Consensus Algorithms**: Explore the impact of Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake, and committee-based consensus algorithms on federated learning.
- **Validation and Aggregation**: Test multiple validation and aggregation mechanisms to evaluate their effectiveness in improving system robustness.

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/necst/FedBlockParadox
cd FedBlocKParadox
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages, including specialized NVIDIA libraries:

```bash
python -m pip install --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com \
    numpy==1.25.2 scipy==1.11.4 matplotlib==3.9.1 tabulate==0.9.0 \
    psutil==5.9.5 datasets==2.19.2 flwr_datasets==0.2.0 flwr==1.9.0 \
    pympler==1.1 tensorrt-bindings==8.6.1 tensorrt-libs==8.6.1 \
    tensorflow[and-cuda]==2.15.0 setproctitle==1.3.3
```

### 3. Prepare Configuration

Ensure you have a valid JSON configuration file for the simulation. Example configuration files are available in the `examples/` directory.

### 4. Run the Simulator

Execute the simulator using the `main` script and specify your configuration file:

```bash
python -m src.main "config_path" \
    2>./tmp.txt 1>./tmp.txt
```

- Replace `config_path` with your specific configuration file.
- Note: tmp.txt will contain general logs generated by various Python modules. The actual log file path is specified in the JSON configuration file.

### 5. Analyze Results

- Review the log file to analyze the simulation's progress and outcomes.
- Use visualization scripts like `logger_to_graph.py` to gain insights.
- If the simulations involve malicious nodes performing label flipping or targeted data poisoning attacks, evaluate their impacts using `label_flipping_score.py` or `targeted_poisoning_score.py`.

## 🐳 Using Docker to Run the Simulator

You can use Docker to simplify dependency management and ensure consistency across environments. Follow the steps below to run the simulator using Docker.

### **1. Build the Docker Image**

Clone the repository (if you haven’t already) and navigate to its directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/necst/FedBlockParadox
cd FedBlockParadox
```

Build the Docker image from the provided `Dockerfile`:

```bash
docker build -t fedblockparadox_image .
```

### **2. Output Storage**

The Docker Compose file provided in this repository is configured to use an external volume (`output`) for storing simulation results and log files. To use this feature:

1. Ensure the volume exists:
   ```bash
   docker volume create output
   ```

### **3. Run the Simulator**

Ensure you have a valid JSON configuration file for the simulation. You can modify the example located in the `container_based_examples/` directory.
Run the Docker container with the required configuration file. For instance:

```bash
docker run -it -d -v ./container_based_examples/config.json:/usr/src/app/config.json fedblockparadox_image
```

- **Flags Explanation**:
  - `-it`: Runs the container interactively with a terminal.
  - `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode, leaving it running in the background.
  - `-v ./container_based_examples/config.json:/usr/src/app/config.json`: Mounts the configuration file from the host system to the container at `/usr/src/app/config.json`.

### **4. Analyze Results**

After the simulation completes:
- Logs and results are saved in the configured output volume.
- Use scripts like `logger_to_graph.py` to visualize the results.

---

## 🔧 Configuration

- Update dependencies and paths as needed.
- Modify scripts to reflect your specific experimental setup.
- Customize datasets and models to fit your use case.
